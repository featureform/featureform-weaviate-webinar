I have a similar story where I built a whole MLOps platform for my last company. It wasn't called MLOps. I don't even know what we called it.```\\n```I think a lot of what I've seen, especially in ML, is everyone has such different pain points. If you're doing your vision and you're a large enterprise or you're fraud detection at a startup, problems you face are different.
